        "Designing a data ingestion pipeline involves a series of steps to collect and store data from various sources. Here's a high-level overview of the design process:\n",
        "\n",
        "Identify data sources: Determine the types of data sources you want to collect from, such as databases, APIs, streaming platforms, or any other relevant sources.\n",
        "\n",
        "Understand data formats and protocols: Each data source may have its own format and protocol for accessing data. Familiarize yourself with the specifics of each source to plan for appropriate data extraction.\n",
        "\n",
        "Extract data: Use appropriate methods to extract data from each source. For databases, you may use SQL queries or database connectors. For APIs, you might need to interact with REST or SOAP endpoints. Streaming platforms may require integration with their specific APIs.\n",
        "Transform and cleanse data: Perform any necessary data transformation and cleansing to ensure consistency and quality. This step may involve converting data formats, standardizing field names, handling missing values, or applying business rules.\n",
        "\n",
        "Validate data: Implement validation checks to ensure the integrity and accuracy of the ingested data. This can include checking data types, ranges, referential integrity, or performing checksum calculations.\n",
        "\n",
        "Load data into storage: Decide on a suitable storage solution, such as a data warehouse, data lake, or cloud-based storage. Load the processed data into the chosen storage using appropriate methods, such as bulk loading, streaming, or batch processing.\n",

        "\n",
        "Real-time analytics and alerting: Apply real-time analytics on the enriched data to detect anomalies, patterns, or events of interest. Generate alerts or notifications based on predefined rules or machine learning models.\n",
        "\n",
        "Store or forward data: Depending on your requirements, store the processed data in a database or data warehouse for further analysis or make it available to downstream applications. Alternatively, forward the data to other systems or APIs for real-time decision-making or integration with other processes.\n",
        "\n",
        "c. Developing a data ingestion pipeline that handles data from different file formats (CSV, JSON, etc.) and performs data validation and cleansing involves the following steps:\n",
        "\n",
        "File ingestion: Configure the pipeline to ingest files from different sources such as local file systems, FTP servers, cloud storage, or streaming platforms.\n",
        "\n",

        "\n",
        "Data parsing: Parse the files based on their detected formats. For example, use CSV parsers or JSON parsers to extract data from the files and convert them into a structured format.\n",
        "\n",
        "Data validation: Apply data validation techniques to ensure the quality and integrity of the ingested data. Perform checks such as data type validation, range validation, schema validation, or business rule validation.\n",
        "\n",
        "Data cleansing: Cleanse the data to remove any inconsistencies, errors, or irrelevant information. This can involve handling missing values, standardizing data formats, deduplicating records, or applying transformations to align the data with the desired structure.\n",
        "\n",
        "Transformation and enrichment: Apply any necessary transformations or enrichment operations on the cleansed data. This step can involve data normalization, aggregations, calculations, or combining data from multiple sources.\n",
        "\n",
        "Load into storage: Store the processed data into a suitable storage solution, such as a database, data warehouse, or data lake. Consider the performance, scalability, and accessibility requirements of your use case when choosing the storage solution.\n",
